## My project work

During the summer period, I worked on the development of CCSync - a web UI + API that helps in retreival of tasks from a [`taskchampion-sync-server`](https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/taskchampion-sync-server) container. The users can thus create, read,
or update tasks on either the Taskwarrior CLI or the frontend (website or the [Taskwarrior flutter app](https://github.com/CCExtractor/taskwarrior-flutter)) and sync them across all their Taskwarrior 3.0 clients (and higher).
My work revolved around creating series of commands on the backend that can be able to perform various actions on the Taskwarrior client of the user, and subsequently integrating all the endpoints to the frontend, i.e., both the [Taskwarrior flutter app](https://github.com/CCExtractor/taskwarrior-flutter) and the [website frontend.](https://github.com/its-me-abhishek/ccsync/tree/main/frontend)

I learnt alot during this process about Golang, React, Docker, Taskwarrior, Flutter, etc.
